## External resources access

Sometimes DBeaver needs to access external internet resources for such tasks as:

- 3rd party JDBC drivers download
- Information about new DBeaver version
- Connect to remote databases outside of your corporate network
- Subscription license activation (commercial version)
- License information update (commercial version)


If you are behind some corporate firewall which restricts access to external internet resources then it may become a real problem.  
Sometimes corporate firewalls allows to access external resources using web browser but restricts this for all other applications.
