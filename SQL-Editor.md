You can create multiple SQL scripts for a single connection. Every script opens in its own SQL editor. 
To open an SQL editor for some connection:
* Click this connection in the [Database Navigator](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Navigator) view and press <kbd>F3</kbd> or click **SQL Editor -> SQL Editor** on the main menu. Alternatively, you click **SQL Editor** on the context menu of this connection. DBeaver opens the Choose SQL script window with saved SQL scripts linked to this connection. CLick the SQL script to open it in a separate tab.
* Click **Recent SQL Editor** on the context menu for this connection or on the main menu (**SQL Editor -> Recent SQL Editor**). This opens the latest used SQL editor. You can also open the most recent SQL editor using <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> shortcut in the Database Navigator view.
* If you need to create a new SQL script, on the main menu, click **SQL Editor -> New SQL Editor** or press <kbd>F3</kbd> and then click **New Script** in the Choose SQL Script window. 

The SQL editor includes the script pane at the top and result tabs at the bottom:

The result tabs represent instances of the [Data Editor](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Data-Editor).

You can create, edit and execute SQL scripts in the script pane and then see the results in the result tabs. 
 
DBeaver uses SQL syntax highlighting which depends on the database associated with the script. Different databases have different sets of reserved keywords and system functions.

NOTE: SQL Editor for a connection is different from SQL console for a table or view (right-click the table and click **Read data in SQL console**) in that, unlike the console, it can save scripts and changes to them.

You can see all your saved SQL scripts in the [Project Explorer](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Project-Explorer) view in the **Scripts** folder.

***Query Parameters***

Dynamic parameters bindings. You can use dynamic parameters in your SQL queries. Parameter format :name. When you execute a query which contains dynamic parameters DBeaver will popup dialog where you can fill parameters’ values. Also you can use anonymous parameters (?) but you will need to enable them in SQL editor preferences.  

***Miscellaneous***

Select of current query row count can be performed by pressing <kbd>CTRL+ALT+C</kbd>.  

You can directly export current query results to a file/table by clicking on “Export From Query” in the context menu. This feature is useful if you have some very long-running query and you don’t need to see it’s results in results panel.  

Execution Log tab contains all queries executed in current SQL editor. You can configure Query Manager settings in global preferences.

Output tab contains all server-side database messages/warnings generated by a database when you execute queries. This feature supported only by a few database engines (Oracle, SQL Server and some other). 

To open current object (under cursor) definition press <kbd>F4</kbd>.  
Hyperlinks: you can press CTRL and move mouse over SQL text. If DBeaver will recognize some identifier as a table/view name then it will be presented as a hyperlink which will navigate to an object editor.  


SQL editor preferences can be opened by pressing <kbd>ALT+ENTER</kbd>.

To toggle (hide/show) results panel press <kbd>F6</kbd>.
To maximize results panel press <kbd>SHIFT+F6</kbd> or double-click on results tab name.
To switch between editor and results panel press <kbd>ALT+F6</kbd>.

Active database/schema selection. To change connection associated with current SQL editor or change active database/schema use combo boxes in the main toolbar.

Transactions management. You can toggle auto-commit mode and transactions isolation level in the main toolbar or main menu “Database”.
