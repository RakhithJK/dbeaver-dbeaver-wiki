You can create multiple SQL scripts for a single connection. Every script opens in its own SQL editor. 
To open an SQL editor for some connection:
* Click this connection in the [Database Navigator](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Navigator) view and press <kbd>F3</kbd> or click **SQL Editor -> SQL Editor** on the main menu. Alternatively, you click **SQL Editor** on the context menu of this connection. DBeaver opens the Choose SQL script window with saved SQL scripts linked to this connection. CLick the SQL script to open it in a separate tab.
* Click **Recent SQL Editor** on the context menu for this connection or on the main menu (**SQL Editor -> Recent SQL Editor**). This opens the latest used SQL editor. You can also open the most recent SQL editor using <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> shortcut in the Database Navigator view.
* If you need to create a new SQL script, on the main menu, click **SQL Editor -> New SQL Editor** or press <kbd>F3</kbd> and then click **New Script** in the Choose SQL Script window. 

The SQL editor includes the script pane at the top and result pane at the bottom:

The results pane displays tabs with results in various formats. The tabs resulting from script execution represent instances of the [Data Editor](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Data-Editor). You can create, edit and execute SQL scripts in the script pane and then see the results in the result tabs. 

The results pane provides **Output** and **Log** views of results.

The execution **Log** tab contains all queries executed in the current SQL editor:

The **Output** tab contains all server-side database messages/warnings generated by a database when you execute queries. This feature is supported only by a few database engines (Oracle, SQL Server and some other ones). 

DBeaver uses SQL syntax highlighting which depends on the database associated with the script. Different databases have different sets of reserved keywords and system functions.

NOTE: SQL Editor for a connection is different from SQL console for a table or view (right-click the table and click **Read data in SQL console**) in that, unlike the console, it can save scripts and changes to them.

You can see all your saved SQL scripts in the [Project Explorer](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Project-Explorer) view in the **Scripts** folder.
