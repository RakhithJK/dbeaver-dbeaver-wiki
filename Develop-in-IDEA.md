### Develop and debug DBeaver in IntelliJ IDEA

Well, that's a tricky part.  

DBeaver is based on [[Eclipse Platform|https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform]] and it seems logical to develop it in [[Eclipse IDE|https://www.eclipse.org/downloads]]. 
However, many people find that event latest Eclipse Java IDE isn't that good and convenient as [[IntelliJ IDEA|https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/]]. I personally also prefer to develop in IDEA, mostly because of historical reasons but also because of many really helpful features in it.  
Anyhow, here we will try to open DBeaver project in IDEA, write code, compile, run and eventually debug (as Java debugger really rocks in IDEA).
