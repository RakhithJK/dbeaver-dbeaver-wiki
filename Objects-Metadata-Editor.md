The metadata editor is available for multiple database objects such as tables and schemas. To open the metadata editor for an object, in the [Database Navigator](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Navigator) or in the [Projects](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Projects) view:
* Double-click the database object
* Click the database object and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>F4</kbd>

The editor has three different tabs - [Properties](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Properties), [Data](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Data) and [ER Diagram](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/ER-Diagram). The tabs have the following common parts:
