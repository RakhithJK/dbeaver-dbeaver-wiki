When you create a new connection to a database, DBeaver automatically connects to the new database, see [Create Connection](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Create-Connection).

If a database connection exists but DBeaver is not connected to the database, the connection appears with its original icon (for example, [[images/ug/DB-icon-not-connected.png]] for PostgreSQL database). When DBeaver connects to the database, the icon changes to signal the connected status: [[images/ug/DB-icon-connected.png]]  
 
To connect to a database using an existing connection, in the [Database Navigator](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Navigator), click the connection and then click the Connect button in the toolbar or click **Database -> Connect** on the main menu:
