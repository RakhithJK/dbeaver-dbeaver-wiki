Console View is an SQL Editor result tab where you can find the results for all executed queries in a text format.

To enable Console View you should press the corresponding button on the left SQL Editor toolbar.

You can execute a single statement or a sql script and see the result set with data, errors, and statistical information along with the corresponding query text.

Don't worry if you close the Console View tab. It will be restored on the new statement execution.

The context menu is available by right-clicking on the Console View area.

For each sql script file, it will be saved whether the Ð¡onsole View is enabled, and the state of the console view button will be restored when the file is opened.

You can set up whether to enable or disable the Console View for new scripts by default in `Preferences->Editors->SQL Editor->Console View`.
