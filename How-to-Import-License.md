To start using DBeaver EE you can

* request a Trial license for 2 weeks https://dbeaver.com/trial/;
* request an Academic license if you are a student or a teacher https://dbeaver.com/academic-license/;
* buy Subscription license, Standard DBeaver EE license or DBeaver EE license extension https://dbeaver.com/buy/.

After purchase DBeaver EE license or getting Trial/Academic license you receive a License Key by email. 
Also, it is available in your personal account on our site https://dbeaver.com/.
The License Key is a unique identification number that contains License ID e. g. DB-821MPZFO-ZA8W, Start date and license owner’s name and company name. It is very important to import your License Key correctly.

## Import from email

You can just copy-paste License Key to import the license into the License Manager. Please, note that you need to copy-paste full license text (not just license ID). License text starts with “–” and ends with “==” characters.
