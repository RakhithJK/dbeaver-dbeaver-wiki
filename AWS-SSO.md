# Using AWS Single Sign On in DBeaver

AWS Single Sign-On is a cloud-based single sign-on (SSO) service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to AWS resources.  
You don't need to specify any user credentials explicitly in DBeaver connections configuration. All authorization is performed in web browser in 3rd party SSO provider, e.g. Google workspace, Microsoft AD portal, Facebook, etc.
