The SQL Assist feature provides auto-completion of database object names in queries. 
To perform some object name auto-complete, press <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> or right-click the required place in the query and click **SQL Assist** on the context menu. DBeaver searches for potentially suitable objects in already loaded database metadata and in the database system tables.

When you start typing SQL keywords, DBeaver offers auto-complete options for them as well.
Another auto-complete function is <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Space</kbd>, it searches for completion only within already entered identifiers.
