The SQL Assist feature provides auto-completion of database object names in queries. 
To perform some object name auto-complete, press <kbd>Ctrl+Space</kbd> or right-click the required place in the query and click **SQL Assist** on the context menu. DBeaver searches for potentially suitable objects in already loaded database metadata and in the database system tables.

Also DBeaver completes SQL keywords. Another auto-complete function is <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE</kbd>, it searches for completion only within already entered identifiers.
