DBeaver supports XML and JSON column types (in relational databases) by using standard JDBC interfaces. This feature was added in JDBC4 so you will need JDBC4 compliant driver for your database.

In the Data Editor, you can edit XML/JSON data right in the table cells, however, a big amount of data may require a larger editor.

To open the full-size XML/JSON editor click the cell containing data in XML/JSON format and press <kbd>Shift<kbd>+<kbd>Enter<kbd>. By default the editor opens on JSON tab, open XML tab to modify XML data.


To auto-format XML/JSON script press <kbd>Ctrl<kbd>+<kbd>Shift<kbd>+<kbd>F<kbd> keyboard buttons.


Use <kbd>Ctrl<kbd>+<kbd>S<kbd> keyboard shortcut to save the changes made.
