A few tips.

- Check existing issues for your issue (including closed issues). Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what youâ€™re running into has been addressed already.
- Be clear about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
- If you posting a bug report check "Error Log" view. If there are any errors related to your bug then post a complete stacktrace. Sometimes there are no errors in Error Log - then try to find them in logs.
- Depending on the nature of your bug report provide information about:
   - Operating system
   - Window manager
   - Database (version)
   - Database driver (version)
- Do not write issue type in the issue title (like Feature Request:, Bug: etc). We'll review your issue and assign a corresponding label.
