**Dashboard Panel** tool allows DBAs and programmers to quickly identify performance, disk space issues, number of connections and other important KPIs associated with a single database connection. To learn more about database connections, see Database Connections. 

Dashboards displayed on the dashboard panel are actually a combination of SQL SELECT scripts being run on a regular basis and charts being built on the data SQL script is extracting.

By default, DBeaver provides a number of predefined sets of dashboards for such data bases as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and Exasol. You can also create custom dashboards for one of these drivers. To learn more about custom dashboards, see Creating a New Dashboard section below.
