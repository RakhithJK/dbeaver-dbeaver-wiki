The toolbar contains buttons for basic and most frequently used commands:

Some of the buttons are enabled (colored), others are disabled (greyed). The sets of enabled and disabled buttons change depending on which editor is currently active in the workbench. Only enabled buttons are applicable to the active editor.

You can customize the toolbar - this is done on **Window -> Customize Perspective -> Tool Bar Visibility** tab.
