**Note: since version 6.2 MockData generator extension is available only in [[Enterprise-Edition]].**

Sometimes in software development we need to generate mock, but valid, data for testing. Populating a database manually is a time-consuming and exhausting process. It can be very complicated when you need to generate not just 5â€“10 users, but thousands of entities of different types. DBeaver Mock Data generator helps you generate test data much easier.

> _Disclaimer:_ The idea behind Mock Data is to generate mock data in a table but it should **NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**. Please make sure you have a backup of your database before running the Mock Data generation process.

Th following are features of DBeaver Mock Data generator:

* Works for all the RDBMS that are supported by DBeaver (DB2, MS SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
* Generates data that matches your database schema:
    * Generated data matches the database column types.
    * All base data types are supported.
    * Constraints (PK, FK, multi-column FK, unique) are supported.
* Supports over 20 configurable data generators (constants, randoms, sequences, names, domains, addresses, prices, regex based, etc.)
* Automatically associates a column with a generator based on the column characteristics
* Saves or overwrites old database data
