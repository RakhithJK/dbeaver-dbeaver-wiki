## Create pull requests

Before creating a pull request you shoulod create a ticket on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/issues). You can leave a commentthatyou are going to implement this feature(or fix a bug) by yourself. DBeaver dev/qa team will reply you with some comments and then you can start working on imlementation.  

You can use the [standard GitHub instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). 
Generally you need to create a fork of `dbeaver/dbeaver` repository, create a new branch, commit your changes and then create a pull request in upstream repository.  

Imprtant: when you commit changes in your branch add ticket number in the commit comment.  
Like this: `dbeaver/dbeaver#issue-number Initial commit for my super-duper feature`.  
You can make any number of commits. We usually perform squash before merging changes in the main repository.
