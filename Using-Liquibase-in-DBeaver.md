DBeaver integrates with Liquibase, an open-source tool that helps you track, manage, and apply database changes.

## Supported Databases

Liquibase works with a variety of databases. The specific databases that DBeaver supports are listed in
the [Schema Compare](Schema-Compare#databases-supporting-schema-comparison) article.

## Using Liquibase in DBeaver

With DBeaver's Liquibase support, you can efficiently manage your database changes. You can create and manage Liquibase
[changelogs](Schema-Compare#liquibase-changelog-generation) directly in DBeaver, making tracking and applying database changes easier. With the [Liquibase PRO key](Schema-Compare#using-schema-compare-with-liquibase-pro-key), you can also
use DBeaver's [Schema Compare](Schema-Compare) feature for an enhanced comparison of database schemas.
