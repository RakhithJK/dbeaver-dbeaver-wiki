DBeaver supports two modes for committing changes to the database:
* **Auto-commit** transfers all changes that you make immediately to the database
* **Manual commit** requires your confirmation before committing a change to the database or rolling it back

Though available in many cases, the two modes are actionable only in [SQL Editor](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/SQL-Editor). See the next sections for details of using the modes.

To switch between the modes, use the mode selection button that appears in one of the two views: [[images/ug/Auto-commit-button.png]] or [[images/ug/Manual-commit-button.png]].
