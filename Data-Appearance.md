The main tool for managing the appearance of the data table is the Result Set/Filter Settings window. To open this window, click the Custom Filters icon (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c49v6wtsr4w7tin/Filter%20settings%20icon.png?raw=1"/>):

This window provides instruments to:
* Order data inside columns
* Manage the display of columns in the table
* Manage the order of columns in the table
* Filter data in the table using an SQL expression, see â€¦ below

## Ordering Data in Columns
In the data table, every column header contains three elements each having its own function:

* Simply clicking the column name or column icon highlights the whole column.
* You can click the column icon and then drag and drop the column to a different position in the table.
* You can click the column name and then drag the cursor right or left to highlight multiple columns. 
* Clicking the ordering icon allows ordering the data in the column in ascending or descending order.

You can order data in columns in one of the ways:
1. Click the ordering icon  (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dfzmn77oko7s9v/Ordering%20icon.png?raw=1"/>) in the header of the column. The icon has three states:
   * Clicking once establishes ascending order (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcxcudkktb9ewkv/Ascending%20order%20icon.png?raw=1"/>) 
   * Clicking a second time changes the order to descending (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uu9hzcjbtwxfozw/Descending%20order%20icon.png?raw=1"/>)  
   * Clicking a third time removes the ordering from the column (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0dfzmn77oko7s9v/Ordering%20icon.png?raw=1"/>)  

To order data by several columns, go column by column, setting the order with the Ordering icon, starting from the column by which you want to order data first.
  
2. Click the Custom Filters icon (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c49v6wtsr4w7tin/Filter%20settings%20icon.png?raw=1"/>) to open the Result Set Order/Filter Settings window (see above):

   a) Next to the column by which you want to order data in the first turn, set the ascending or descending order using the same three-state principle as described above.  
   b) Set the ordering in other columns by which you want to sort data in the second, third, etc. turn. The **Order** column indicates the order in which the sorting will happen.  
   NOTE: The number (**#**) column indicates the initial order of columns.  
   c) To easily move the ordering setting from column to column, you can use the Move up/down/to top/to bottom/ buttons: <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmn35r0pjv0pjde/Up-Down%20buttons.png?raw=1"/>   

To reset the data ordering to its initial state, click the Reset button (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/djtedg8jjid1udm/Reset%20button.png?raw=1"/>).

Also, to remove all ordering settings, click the Remove All Filters/Orderings button (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvqyaz3blha7wf2/Remove%20all%20filters%20button.png?raw=1"/>)
in the top toolbar.
