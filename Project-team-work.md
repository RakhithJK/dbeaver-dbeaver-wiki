### Work with Project (Connections, Scripts, etc.)

If some changes were made, e.g., Connection, Script or ERD was created, deleted or changed and you want to update your remote repository, you should:

1. Go to the Context menu of the project (**Projects** tab) and choose `Team - Commit`

2. **Git Staging** tab is opened at the bottom of the screen. **Unstaged Changes** are shown here. Add needed changes to the index using **Add Selected files to the index** or **Add all files to the index** button (highlighted at the picture), input commit message and then Commit changes (`Commit` button or `Ctrl+Enter`). Commit appears at the History tab (Main menu: `Window - Show view - Other - Version Control(Team) - History`).

3. At the second step also could be used `Commit and Push` button. In case you need to Push changes, it could be done from Project context menu (`Team - Remote - Push`) or from **History** tab in case it is needed to push not all commits (right click at needed commit - Push commit). Changes should appear in your git repository.

### Pulling New Changes from Upstream Branch

Right-click on a project in the **Project** Tab and select `Team - Pull` or right-click on a repository in the Git Repositories view and select **Pull** to pull new changes from the upstream branch your local branch is tracking. 

If you did no local change or want to discard your local changes, use `Team - Reset`
