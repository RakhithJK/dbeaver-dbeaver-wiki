The default grid view of query resulting data is not very much impressive, especially to business analysts and other end users. The **Charts** feature lets you quickly and easily  turn your SELECT queries' output into a colorized bar chart.

To visualize your data in a bar chart press the **Charts** button     in the **Data Editor** bottom toolbar. A bar chart will be created.

You can export Ð° chart into PNG format by selecting the **Save as..** option in the chart's context menu.

To edit chart settings select the **Charts..** option in the chart's context menu. The following chart settings can be adjusted:

**Axis X**: In the **Column** drop down list of available columns select a column whose data will be used on axis X of the bar chart. Make sure you choose unique columns for X axis. Define a user-friendly axis name in the **Label** text field.

**Axis Y**: In the **Column** drop down list of available columns select a column whose data will be used on axis Y of the bar chart. Note, that only columns containing numeric data can be used for axis Y. Define a user-friendly axis name in the **Label** text field.

You can also set the following options: 

* Sample count
* Row count
* Sample function
