### Open New Connection wizard
If you run DBeaver for the first time (standalone version) then new connection wizard will appear automatically.
Otherwise click on "New Connection" item in the main toolbar or in the Database Navigator view toolbar or in the main menu "Database".

#### Choose a driver for your new connection

To quickly find needed driver you may type a hint in the top text field.  
If you can't find a driver for your database then maybe you need to create a new one.  
Refer to [[Create database driver|Create-database-driver]] article.  

#### Configuring connection

Set all primary connection properties.
For most drivers required fields are:
- host
- port
- database name 
- user name and password
However number and type of connection properties are very dependent on driver.
