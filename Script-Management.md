## Saving Scripts
You can save scripts to a predefined space in the currently active project or somewhere in the file system.

To save a script to the current project space, just press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> or right-click the script and click **Save** on the context menu. You can find the saved script in the [Project Explorer](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Project-Explorer) view in the **Scripts** folder.

To save a script to the file system, right-click the script, click **File -> Save SQL script** on the context menu and then select the folder in the file system.

## Loading Scripts
To load a script stored in the file system to the SQL Editor, right-click the script pane and click **File -> Load SQL script** on the context menu. 

## Renaming Scripts
To rename a script, right-click anywhere in the script pane, click **File -> Rename SQL Script** on the context menu, then enter the new name in the Rename SQL script dialog box and click **OK**.  

## Exporting Query
You can directly export the current query results to a file/table by right-clicking the query and then clicking **Execute -> Export From Query** on the context menu. This feature is useful if you have some very long-running query and you do not need to see itâ€™s results in results panel.
