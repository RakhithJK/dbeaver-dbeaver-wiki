The ODBC driver allows you to create a connection in DBeaver to almost any database using that database's native driver. You can use it as an alternative to the DBeaver driver or if DBeaver doesn't have a driver for your database.

**Note: This feature is available only for Windows in [Lite](Lite-Edition), [Enterprise](Enterprise-Edition), and [Ultimate](Ultimate-Edition) editions.**

## How to connect to the database via ODBC

First open **New Database connection** and select ODBC.

Then select a data source.

If you want to add your database driver manually, switch to the  **Manual** mode, select your driver and add host, database name and other parameters.

That is it. You can test the connection.
