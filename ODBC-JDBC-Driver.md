The ODBC driver allows you to create a connection in DBeaver to almost any database using its native ODBC driver. You can use it as an alternative to the DBeaver driver or if DBeaver doesn't have a driver for your database.

**Note: This feature is available only for Windows in [Lite](Lite-Edition), [Enterprise](Enterprise-Edition), and [Ultimate](Ultimate-Edition) editions.**

## How to connect to the database via ODBC

1. Open **New Database connection** and select ODBC
2. Select a desired data source

If you want to add your database driver manually, switch to the  **Manual** mode, select the desired driver, then fill host, port, database name, and other parameters:

That's it. You can save the connection and use it.
