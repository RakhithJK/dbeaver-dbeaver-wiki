Instructions for resellers
Now you can process a reseller purchase order on our site.
Once you selected a product on the Buy page and came to the Checkout page you need to enter your reseller discount code. 
 
Confirmation reseller status
After that you are required to confirm your reseller status. Thus, we conclude a social contract. If you click the checkbox, you will get a reseller account. Also, your discount code will be applied automatically for your next purchases.
 
If you already have an account on our site, you can firstly login and then confirm your reseller status. Your existing account will be transformed to the reseller one.

Fill order details
Then you enter PO number, Customer PO number (if exists) and End user details: first name, last name, email, company name. This information is required to create a license correctly.
After the purchase, the license key will be available in the end user’s personal account. If the license end user has not been signed up on our website, the account will be created automatically. The new user will receive a welcome email with a link to set up a password.
If you click the checkbox ‘Notify end user’, an email with a license key text will be sent to the end user too. Please, note: the invoice and payment details will not be sent to the end user anyway.
