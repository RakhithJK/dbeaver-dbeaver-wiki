Sometimes in software development we need to generate mock but valid data for the testing. Filling in the database by hand is a time-consuming and exhausting process. It can be very complicated when you need to generate not just 5â€“10 users, but thousands entities of different types. DBeaver Mock Data generator helps you generate test data much easier. 

> _Disclaimer:_ Mock data idea is to generate fake data in the table and it is **NOT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**. Please ensure you have a backup of your database before running the Mock Data generation process.
