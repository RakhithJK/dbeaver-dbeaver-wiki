You can execute a query in several ways.

- To execute a query under cursor or selected text, press <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> or right-click the query and click **Execute -> Execute SQL Statement** on the context menu. You can do the same from the main menu: **SQL Editor -> Execute SQL Statement**. This executes the SQL query under cursor or selected text and fills the results pane with query results.
- To execute a query under cursor in a separate tab, press <kbd>CTRL+\ </kbd> or right-click the query and click **Execute -> Execute SQL in new tab** on the context menu. Same can be done from the main menu: **SQL Editor -> Execute SQL in new tab**. This executes the SQL query under cursor or selected text and creates a new results tab.
- To execute the whole script, press <kbd>ALT+X</kbd>. This executes all queries in the current editor (or selected queries) as a script. DBeaver parses queries one by one using a statements delimiter (“;” by default) and executes them consequently. You can configure the script execution behavior in the SQL editor preferences (in the bottom toolbar, click **Configure** (<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/iebvq6vomzwqls4/Configure%20button.png?raw=1"/>) -> **Preferences**).
- Execute a script opening each query results in a separate tab (<kbd>CTRL+ALT+X</kbd>). The same as script execution but opens multiple result tabs. Each script query will be executed in a separate thread (i.e. all queries are executed simultaneously). Be careful with this feature – if you’ll execute a huge script with big number of queries it may lead to unexpected problems.
