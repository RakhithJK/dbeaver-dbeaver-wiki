ER diagrams appear on the rightmost tab of the [Database Object Editor](Database-Object-Editor):

Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD) are graphic presentations of database entities and the relations between them. DBeaver allows you to view the diagrams of existing tables and whole database schemas, see [Database Structure Diagrams](Database-Structure-Diagrams). DB also allows the creation of custom diagrams, see
[Custom Diagrams](Custom-Diagrams).  
By default DBeaver uses [IDEF1X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEF1X) notation.

Both types of diagrams provide the same tools to adjust their view and structure. They can be printed and exported to image file formats.

## Selection of Elements in Diagrams
You can use one of the two tools to select elements in diagrams:
* Select â€“ supports both, single and multi-select modes. To select a single element (table, connection, entity inside a table) in a diagram, just click that element. To select multiple elements, similar to using the Marquee tool, click outside the first element and draw until all elements you need are in focus:

## Structure Adjustment
NOTE: All changes to existing database schemas cannot be saved and are intended for exploration purposes only.  
You can do the following structural changes in the diagrams.
*  Add new tables to a diagram by drag-n-dropping them onto the diagram field from the [Database Navigator](Database-Navigator).
*  Rearrange tables in the diagram by dragging them all over the space. You can select several tables and drag them to a new location.
*  Auto-arrange tables into a compact view after manual rearrangements: click the **Arrange Diagram** (![](images/ug/Arrange-diagrams.png)) in the toolbar or on the context menu (right-click anywhere on the diagram tab).
*  (Available for [Custom Diagrams](Custom-Diagrams) only) - connect tables with a connector: click the **Show Palette** button (![](images/ug/Show-pallette-icon.png)) in the upper-left corner of the diagram tab and then, in the Palette panel, click **Connection**:

   Now click the tables that you want to connect with each other in turn, one by one. To stop the connection line, double-click the last table
*  (Available for [Custom Diagrams](Custom-Diagrams) only) - removes tables and connections: right-click the table or conection and click **Delete** on the context menu or just click the table or connection and press <kbd>Delete</kbd>.

## View Adjustment
You can adjust the view of any diagram in the following ways:
* Enable/disable the diagram grid: Click **Toggle Grid** (![](images/ug/Toggle-grid.png)) in the toolbar.
* Modify attributes visibility: Right-click the diagram and, on the context menu, click **Show Attributes** and then select one of the options:
  - **All** - all attributes  
  - **Any keys** - primary and foreign keys  
  - **Primary key** - only primary keys  
  - **None** - no attributes  
* Modify attributes presentation: Right-click the diagram and, on the context menu, click **View Styles** and then select one of the options:
  - **Show Icons**
  - **Show Data Types**
  - **Show Nullability**
  - **Show Comments**
  - **Show Fully qualified names**
* Change the color of the entities/notes: Right-click the header of the entity or comment and then click **Set color** on the context menu. Then you can select the color and click **OK**. 
* For elements located in front of/behind others, bring an element to the front or send it to the back: Right-click the element and then click **Bring to front** / **Send to back** on the context menu.
* Zoom the diagram in/out: Click the **Zoom In**/**Zoom Out** buttons or choose the scaling value in the dropdown list in the toolbar: ![](images/ug/ERD-zoom.png)

## Refresh
To see changes made by others to the database schema, you might need to refresh the diagram: click **Refresh Diagram** (![](images/ug/Refresh-projects-icon.png)) in the toolbar.



## Notes
You can create notes only in [Custom Diagrams](Custom-Diagrams). To create a note, click the **Show Palette** button (![](images/ug/Show-pallette-icon.png)) in the upper-left corner of the diagram tab. Then, in the Palette panel, click **Note** and click anywhere in the diagram tab. Now you can double-click the **Note** box to enter the note text:

To remove the filter, click the cross icon next to the search field.
