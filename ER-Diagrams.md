### Database structure view
You can view database structure in standard ERD (Entity Relation Diagram) form.  
ER diagrams are available for all tables and schemas (databases).  
Find a table in database navigator, double click on it and switch to `Diagram` tab:
[[images/erd-table.png]]
Double click on schema name or on `Tables` node to see full schema diagram:

<b>Note:</b> table and schema diagrams are read-only. You can rearrange layout, drag-n-drop elements inside diagram but you can't save it's state and/or delete/add anything. This is because diagram represents actual state of database.
