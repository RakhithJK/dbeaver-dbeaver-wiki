Entity Relation Diagrams (ERD) are graphic presentations of database entities and relations between them. DBeaver allows viewing diagrams of existing tables and whole database schemas, see [Database Structure Diagrams](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Structure-Diagrams), as well as create custom diagrams, see 
[Custom Diagrams](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Custom-Diagrams)
