You can buy DBeaver EE license and then you need to reassign it to the end user.

Sometimes the named user is leaving the company or the team that is using DBeaver EE so the license admin may need to reassign the license to another employee.

You can reassign the license to another user in your personal account.

Firstly, you need to Sign in https://dbeaver.com/signin/.

Secondly, you should open the **Licenses tab**, where you can find all your licenses.
